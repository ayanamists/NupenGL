# What is NupenGL

NupenGL is a Nuget package containing a collection of commonly used OpenGL libraries. Install it and you should be ready to use:

* OpenGL
* FreeGLUT
* GLFW
* GLEW

## How to Use NupenGL

Just install the NupenGL.Core Nuget package, which will also auto-install its dependency NupenGL.Redist.

* NupenGL.Core contains header and lib files.
* NupenGL.Redist contains DLLs.

No more worrying about searching the web for the appropriate lib, header and DLL files.
